# Building-Energy-Consumption-Analysis
In this data-driven project, I utilized machine learning techniques to analyze and predict energy consumption in buildings based on various factors such as building type, square footage, occupancy, appliance usage, and environmental conditions. The goal was to develop an AI-driven model that could forecast energy usage and help optimize resource.

# Building Energy Consumption Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict energy consumption in buildings based on various factors such as square footage, occupancy, appliance usage, and environmental conditions. The goal is to develop an AI-driven model that can accurately forecast energy usage and assist in optimizing resource management in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Employed for creating regression models.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations of the data and results.
- **Google Colab**: Used for executing and sharing the Jupyter notebooks in a cloud environment.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Analysis**: Explored relationships between energy consumption and variables like temperature, day of the week, and building occupancy.
- **Model Development**: Built and trained predictive models using regression techniques to forecast energy consumption.
- **Feature Engineering**: Processed data to enhance model performance, including handling missing values and selecting relevant variables.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
